## Downloading

Binary distributions can be found: [here](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/releases/latest).

Select the appropriate file for the target platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Binaries are provided in `.zip` format, while source code is provided in `.zip` and `.tar.gz` format.

## Installing

### Installing on Windows

Extract the *.zip* file (`turtlecoin-...-windows.zip`).

### Installing on Mac

Extract the *.zip* file:

```bash
unzip turtlecoin-...-mac.zip
```

### Installing on Linux

Extract the *.zip* file:

```bash
unzip turtlecoin-...-linux.zip
```

## Synchronizing the Blockchain

Running `TurtleCoind` will start the *TurtleCoind* network daemon, which will connect to the network and begin downloading and verifying the TurtleCoin blockchain.  

Because the blockchain is constantly growing, the file size always increases (the blockchain is currently over 35 GB), and *TurtleCoind must verify every block*, which is both CPU and disk intensive. An SSD with at least this much free disk space is recommended, unless you plan to use [remote nodes](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Using-remote-nodes). 

### Using Checkpoints

In **versions 0.4.3+** you can sync a fresh chain from block 0 much quicker by using checkpoints. Follow [this guide](Using-checkpoints) to learn more.

### Windows

Run the `TurtleCoind.exe` executable extracted from the Windows binary zip:

### Mac / Linux

Run the `TurtleCoind` binary extracted from the `.zip` download:

```bash
./TurtleCoind
```

## Using Zedwallet

With `TurtleCoind` still running in the background or another terminal/shell/command prompt, open zedwallet:

#### Windows

Run the `zedwallet.exe` executable from the extracted folder.

#### Mac / Linux

```bash
./zedwallet
```

### Using Zedwallet commands

Zedwallet has a twin command system; a numerical shortcut for navigating the menu, and typed commands you can access directly.  The more you use Zedwallet the more typed commands you'll pick up.  This guide is written using the numerical system.  Just remember that both rules apply.

### Viewing Wallet Address

To view a wallet's public address; at the menu, type `2` and press `enter`.

```
[TRTL trtl]: 2
TRTLuxqfDys1pfQ1omkHMVViY4sFh6My5Ff3HBY8XPp3cJBkEfD7romVyzKug3mb9NNR4A8kEjZxZ9CHUgWckBSpPfbxnWAQUGL
[TRTL trtl]:
```

### Exporting Keys

Each TurtleCoin  wallet is essentially, just a pair of keys (*View Key* and *Spend Key*) from which the public address is derived.
It is **very** important to export these keys and back them up somewhere that is safe and secure (meaning somewhere reliable/permanent that no one else can access).

In the event of a lost or corrupted wallet file, computer crash, etc., the *View Key* and *Spend Key* are the only way to restore a wallet and recover the funds it holds.

**DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**. **Anyone who has these can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**

To print your keys; at the menu type `4` and press `enter`.
The *View Key* and *Spend Key* will appear. Copy them and store them **safely and securely**.

```
[TRTL trtl]: 4
Enter password: **********
Private spend key: 41c834f7c26e12373e5c39a9c9b1f8beb665324ad0d098cabda1234567b5d30f

### Viewing Wallet Balance

To view your wallet's balance; at the menu, type `3` and press `enter`:

```
[TRTL trtl]: 3
Available balance: 1000.00 TRTL
Locked (unconfirmed) balance: 100.00 TRTL
Total balance: 1100.00 TRTL
[TRTL trtl]:
```

### Sending TurtleCoin Transactions<a name="tx-trtl"></a>

To send Turtlecoin; at the Zedwallet menu:

- Type: `7` and press `enter`

- Type/paste the address you want to send the TRTL to and press `enter`

- Type the amount of TRTL you want to send (like `100`) and press `enter`

- Press `enter` to use the default fee of 0.1 TRTL (or set it higher if you're sending a large amount of TRTL)

- Enter the payment ID if the recipient has provided one. Check the [payment ID section](#tx-trtl-p-id) if you're not sure when/how to use it

- If you make a mistake or need to stop the transaction, type `cancel` at any time

- Confirm that the details are correct and enter `y`. If something is amiss, enter `n` and follow the steps again

- Enter your password

Depending on the amount you transfer, you may need to wait a while for confirmation.  If you have had too many small incoming transactions, or the amount you wish to send is too large; either break up your transfer into several smaller amounts, or optimise your wallet.

Example:

![transfer](guides/wallets/images/transfer-simple.png)


#### Optimizing your Wallet

Fusion transactions take all your (small) incoming payments and combine them into bigger ones, allowing you to send huge sums at once!

To optimize your wallet, type `16` and press `enter`:
```
[TRTL trtl]: 16
Attempting to optimize your wallet to allow you to send large amounts at once. 
This may take a very long time!
Do you want to proceed? (Y/n): y
Running optimization round 1...
Full optimization completed!
[TRTL trtl]: 
```

When it is completed, it will print out a green message `Full optimization completed!`

![optimize](guides/wallets/images/optimize-simple.png)

#### Payment ID<a name="tx-trtl-p-id"></a>

Because transactions on the TurtleCoin blockchain are privatized, in some situations a payment ID is necessary for the recipient to be able to determine where the payment came from, for instance when depositing to an exchange or other service.

**You need it if you're sending TRTL to an exchange, the tipbot or RainBorg**.

To send a transaction with a payment ID, enter it when prompted to.

![p-id](guides/wallets/images/p-id-simple.png)

Note that typically, the service/recipient will generate and provide the required payment ID.

### Exiting the Wallet

Wallets loaded into the *zedwallet* client must be synced with the blockchain in order to properly calculate balance, view transaction history, etc.

It is important to properly save the wallet data before exiting *zedwallet* so that the synchronized data is not lost.

To save a wallet's data and exit; at the menu, type `5` and press `enter`:

```
[TRTL trtl]: 5
Shutting down...
Saving wallet file...
Shutting down wallet interface...
Shutting down node connection...
Bye.
```
