# ðŸ“œ Making a Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

You can view a guide on how to make a wallet [here](../../docs/guides/Making-a-Wallet/)

There are two options for a paper wallet.

#### Generating the Wallet

* Click on `Generate a Wallet`
* Mash your keyboard and start entering a bunch of random letters, numbers and signs in the field. Make sure you toggle on Caps Lock repeatedly! (Don't go too crazy - otherwise you might end up shutting down your PC!)
* After you're done mashing your keyboard, press `Generate Wallet`
* The letters and numbers in the green box, starting with `SEKR`, is your public address. You can share it freely.
* Save the `Seed Phrase`, the 25 words in the red box, safely.\
  **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**.\
  **Anyone who has access to this can&#x20;**_**access your funds**_**&#x20;and has&#x20;**_**complete control**_**&#x20;over your wallet.**
* Save the `Spend Key` and the `View Key`, the two very long strings of (seemingly) random letters and numbers, safely.\
  **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**.\
  **Anyone who has access to this can&#x20;**_**access your funds**_**&#x20;and has&#x20;**_**complete control**_**&#x20;over your wallet.**
