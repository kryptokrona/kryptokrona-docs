# Making a TurtleCoin Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for TurtleCoin, paper wallets, CLI wallets, GUI wallets and Web Wallets (under development).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

## Zedwallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called zedwallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

If you would like to use zedwallet, you can check out [this guide](Using-zedwallet).

## Graphical Wallet (GUI Wallet)

If you prefer to use a GUI wallet, the currently suggested wallet is [Electron Wallet](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-electron).

If you would like to setup a GUI wallet, you can take a look at [this guide](Making-a-GUI-Wallet).
