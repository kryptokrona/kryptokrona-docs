1. Select `CryptonightLight v1` from the `Select Algorithm` dropdown menu.
2. Specify how many cores you want to use. We recommend using half of how many cores your phone has. So if your phone has 6 cores, enter `3`
3. Enter a pool of your choice in the format `stratum+tcp://pool_url_address:pool_port`.
   For Example `stratum+tcp://pool.trtl.unipool.pro:3333`. To view a list of pools, you can go [here](Pools)
4. Enter your TurtleCoin wallet address
5. Enter the password of the pool. For most, it will be `x`
6. Click on the `Start Mining` button to start mining.

## Expected Results

The miner should now start mining and stats like hashrate and accepted shares will be displayed
