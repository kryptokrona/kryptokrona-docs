# How to Bootstrap the TurtleCoin Blockchain

This guide will help you install a recent copy of the blockchain. This should significantly speed up the task of getting the blockchain synced up so you can use your wallet.

## Windows:
1. Make sure `TurtleCoind.exe`, `walletd.exe`, and/or the GUI wallet are not running.

2. Open File Explorer and Type `%APPDATA%\TurtleCoin` and hit enter.

**Note: if the folder doesn't exist, just go to %APPDATA% instead and create the TurtleCoin folder.**

3. Delete the following if they exist:

 * blockindexes.bin
 * blocks.bin
 * "DB" folder
 
    Note: In case it is unable to delete the files due to them being used by some other program, follow these steps:
    - Open Task Manager with the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift+ Escape`.
    - Click on `Processes`.
    - Click on `Image Name`.
    - Scroll to the bottom.
    - Click on `walletd.exe`.
    - Click on `End Process`.
    - Click on `End Process` again.
    - Try to delete them again.


4. [Download](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/turtle-blockchain/latest.zip) the latest snapshot of the blockchain.

5. Move the two new downloaded files the `%APPDATA%\TurtleCoin` folder.

6. Start `TurtleCoind.exe` or the GUI like you normally do.

7. See [Expected Results](#ExpectedResults) section below.



## Mac & Linux:
1. Make sure `TurtleCoind`, `walletd`, and/or the GUI are not running.

2. Open `Finder`.

3. Use the shortcut `Command + Shift + G` to bring up `Go to Folder`:

4. [Download](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/turtle-blockchain/latest.zip) the latest snapshot of the blockchain.

When you start `TurtleCoind` you should see this. Note that the blocksize (150246) in this example will be a different number.

2018-Feb-01 18:43:40.830674 INFO    Imported block with index 6000 / 150246
```

After it completes it will start syncing incrementally like so:
```
2018-Feb-01 18:47:48.075930 INFO    Imported block with index 150000 / 150246
2018-Feb-01 18:47:48.860470 INFO    Core initialized OK
2018-Feb-01 18:47:48.860470 INFO    Initializing p2p server...
```

If you are using the GUI, you can instead view the progress by opening `walletd.log` and scrolling to the bottom.
