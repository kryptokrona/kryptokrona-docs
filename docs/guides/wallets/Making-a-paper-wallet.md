# Setting Up a Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paperwallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds. 

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

There are two options for a paper wallet.

## Making A Paper Wallet on an Internet-Connected Machine

Go to [this link](https://turtlecoin.lol/wallet) and follow these steps-

  - Click on `Generate a Wallet`
  
  - Mash your keyboard and start entering a bunch of random letters, numbers and signs in the field. Make sure you toggle on Caps Lock repeatedly! (Don't go too crazy - otherwise you might end up shutting down your PC!)
  
  - After you're done mashing your keyboard, press `Generate Wallet`
  
  - The letters and numbers in the green box, starting with `TRTL`, is your public address. You can share it freely. We recommend [registering it with trtlbot++](Using-trtlbot-plus-plus#registering-your-wallet) in the Discord so that you can access it easily.
  
  - Save the `Seed Phrase`, the 25 words in the red box, safely. **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**. **Anyone who has access to this can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**
  
  - Save the `Spend Key` and the `View Key`, the two very long strings of (seemingly) random letters and numbers, safely.  **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**. **Anyone who has access to this can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**
