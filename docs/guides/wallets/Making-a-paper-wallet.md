# Setting Up a Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

You can view a guide on how to make a wallet [here](Making-a-Wallet)

There are two options for a paper wallet.

  -  Install git if it's not already installed (`apt-install git`)

  - Type, `git clone https://github.com/turtlecoin/paper-turtle.git`and press enter

  - Then enter `cd paper-turtle`

  - After doing so, enter `index.html`

  - Follow [these steps.](#generating-the-wallet)

### Generating the Wallet

- Click on `Generate a Wallet`

- Mash your keyboard and start entering a bunch of random letters, numbers and signs in the field. Make sure you toggle on Caps Lock repeatedly! (Don't go too crazy - otherwise you might end up shutting down your PC!)

- After you're done mashing your keyboard, press `Generate Wallet`

- The letters and numbers in the green box, starting with `TRTL`, is your public address. You can share it freely. We recommend [registering it with trtlbot++](../Using-trtlbot-plus-plus#registering-your-wallet) in the [Discord server](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol/) so that you can access it easily(you can also get tips!).

- Save the `Seed Phrase`, the 25 words in the red box, safely.  
**DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**.  
**Anyone who has access to this can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**

- Save the `Spend Key` and the `View Key`, the two very long strings of (seemingly) random letters and numbers, safely.  
**DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**.  
**Anyone who has access to this can *access your funds* and has *complete control* over your wallet.**
