# List of Mining Pools

Unless you want to solo mine, which is unfeasible for many people, you will need a pool to mine towards. Make sure to choose the one closest to you!

Here are some of the TurtleCoin mining pools (arranged alphabetically):

## Definition of Fees

Rather simple; the pool operator will take a percentage of the reward of the block found for himself.

Example-

- the fee is 0.1%
- the block reward is 30000 TRTL
- 30000 x 0.1% = 30

Therefore, the pool operator will take 30 TRTL for himself.



## Definition of Different Types of Methods

### Proportional

A proportional pool carries no risk to the pool operator as miners are simply paid out when a block is found. No blocks, no payout!

With a proportional pool the risk is all on the miners if it takes longer than expected to find a block then the miners earn less. On the flip side, if the pool is lucky (they will all average out the same eventually) the miners get more.

Example-

- A block is found after 100,000 shares
- You submitted 1,000 of those shares (you have 1% of the pool's total hash power)
- There’s 30000 TRTL per block

Quite simply you will get 1% of the block = 300 TRTL.

Now if the pool has a bad round (a round is the time taken to find a block) and it takes 200,000 shares to find a block (twice as long) and you have submitted 2,000 shares (as you’ve been mining twice as long), you still only get 1% of the block = 300 TRTL

This can also work in the miners favour too, as if it takes half the time (50,000 shares) to find a block and you submitted only 500 shares - again 1% - 300 TRTL.

Basically, you always get a percentage of the block and you win/lose depending on the “luck” of the pool.



The drawbacks to a proportional pool are that there is often a fee although some pool operators rely on donations only and you will have to bear the variance of the block times and luck unlike a PPLNS pool.

Also they are susceptible to “pool hoppers” where PPLNS pools are not.

### PPLNS (Pay Per Last *n* Shares)

PPLNS does not pay out per block found, rather it pays based on the number of shares you last submitted, and helps to dissuade pool hoppers.

How it works is,

* you start mining with a PPLNS pool.
* Rather than paying you out based on the number of shares you submitted since you started mining/the last block was found, it will pay depending on how many shares you submitted in a period of time, called the window, which is an estimate of the time in which the pool in question finds a block.
* So, after you start mining, it will take a few hours for you to earn your normal earnings - and since the effect of pool hoppers is lessened, you may make comparatively more than other methods.

Basically, you get paid based on

- the number of shares you submitted
- and how long you have been mining.
