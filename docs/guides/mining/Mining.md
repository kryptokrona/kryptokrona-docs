title: Mining Intro
---

Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the TurtleCoin network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with some TurtleCoin.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.
