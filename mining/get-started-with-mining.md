So you want to start mining XKR? Great! This is the place to start.

## Download

First order of business is to download the mining software, although there are many alternatives to choose between, we recommend XMRig.

Download XMRig here:

[Windows](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/download/v5.11.1/xmrig-5.11.1-msvc-cuda10_1-win64.zip)

[Linux](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/download/v5.11.1/xmrig-5.11.1-xenial-x64.tar.gz)

_**Note to Windows users**_\
&#xNAN;_&#x59;our antivirus software may react to the mining software, this is because viruses often download mining software to unknowing peoples PC's, hijacking their computer for unwanted mining. Just add a rule in your anti virus software to prevent this._ [_Here's a guide_](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/exclude-nicehash-miner-from-windows-defender-immediately)_._



## Configure

You need a config-file for the miner in order to mine. Generate one [here](https://www.kryptokrona.org/en/mining).

Don’t have a XKR address? Get one [here](https://explorer.kryptokrona.se/tools.html) (don't forget to save your mnemoic seed so you can access your funds with a wallet).

After you've generated your config.json file, place it into your XMRig folder.
