  If you've just set up your node, it's a good idea to use our bootstrap to make
  the initial sync a lot faster!

# ðŸ¥¾ Node bootstrap

Starting in your home folder (cd \~), the first order of business is to download our bootstrap with this command:

```
wget https://xkrbootstrap.vm-app.cloud.cbh.kth.se/latest.7z
```

After it has downloaded, use this command to extract the file:

```
// apt install 7z (if you don't have it installed)
7z x latest.7z
```

Then just start the node, which you can read up on how to do in the other guides! Thanks for hosting a node, and don't forget to add it to [https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-public-nodes/](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-public-nodes/) if you want to make it public in our apps!
